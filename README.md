# jrCollection

This is a collection of all my games, which at the moment are all unfinished.

These are all amalgamated into a single project for the purpose of being able to reuse the engine without having to worry about properly versioning it. At some point, I'll probably add build targets that place each game into an individual executable. Also, I'm still trying to figure out a system for versioning assets. For now, they are checked into git, but I will probably retroactively delete them from this repository once I find a place to host them to reclaim space.

Feel free to try them out, provide feedback, and make changes. If this gains popularity at some point, I might put a donation link here.
